            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Srivin K, a Data Scientist from Kochi, Kerala, with a deep passion for data and technology. My journey into the world of data science began with a Bachelor’s degree in BCom Computer Applications from Kannur University. But my real dive into data came when I pursued specialized training in Big Data, Data Science, and Data Analytics from Luminar Technolab, Kochi.</p>

            <p>During this time, I discovered the power of Python for analyzing and manipulating data, which completely fascinated me. I spent countless hours working on real-world projects that allowed me to apply machine learning algorithms and create predictive models. Every dataset felt like a puzzle waiting to be solved, and each solution I found was a step closer to making data-driven decisions easier for others.</p>

            <p>I became proficient in tools like SQL for database management, and Tableau and Power BI for creating powerful visualizations that transform raw data into meaningful insights. I realized that telling stories through data was my calling, and it’s something I’ve worked hard to master. Whether it’s visualizing trends, identifying patterns, or optimizing processes, I find joy in helping businesses see beyond the numbers.</p>

            <p>As a Data Scientist, I’m excited about the opportunity to use my expertise to help unlock the full potential of data for businesses and make data-driven strategies a reality. I look forward to exploring new opportunities where I can further sharpen my skills and make a real impact in the field of data science.</p>
